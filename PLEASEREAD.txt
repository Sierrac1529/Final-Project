i am still working on this as i am still figuring out how to upload to glitch. everything else works if the files are locally stored and refered to as such and node is ran with server.js.

for example, in the routes.js file,  instead of 

			dir = "github.com/Sierrac1529/Final-Project"

having it as 

			dir = "C:/Users/clarkes/Desktop/Project"

i was able to successfully execute the other functions of the website such as the login, register, ect.
