i am still working on this. I can't figure out how to update the pug file to include the videos that are in the database, but everything else works if the files are locally stored and refered to as such.

for example, in the routes.js file,  instead of 

			dir = "github.com/Sierrac1529/Final-Project"

having it as 

			dir = "C:/Users/clarkes/Desktop/Project"

i was able to successfully execute the other functions of the website such as the login, register, ect.
